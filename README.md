### Isolated ISE Probe Interface

> Use any Ion Specific Electrode
- Measure pH with temperature compensation
- Measure ORP and Eh
- Raw mV
- Temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit
- Electrically Isolated

#### What it is
An I2C slave device that can interface with any voltage based sensor such as a pH or ORP probe. There are pin headers available to connect a DS18B20 temperature sensor for automatic temperature compensation. The firmware on the device provides two calibration options, single or dual point.

#### Using it
There is extensive [documentation](http://ufire.co/docs/uFire_ISE/) on the use and setup of the device. The library to use it is in the Arduino IDE, Particle.io IDE and a python implementation for Raspberry Pi and MicroPython is also available.

~~~
#include "uFire_ISE.h"
uFire_ISE mv;
mv.measuremV();
~~~
~~~
#include "uFire_pH.h"
uFire_pH ph;
ph.measurepH();
~~~
~~~
#include "uFire_ORP.h"
uFire_ORP orp;
orp.measureORP();
~~~

##### Isolation

When different probes are connected to the same controlling device, they can cause interference. The environment also causes interference due to ground-loops or other electrical noise like pumps. Electrically isolating the probe from the controlling device can help to prevent it.

All Î¼Fire probe interfaces come with electrical isolation hardware which provides a stable, isolated power supply and I2C bus between the interface and your controlling device.
